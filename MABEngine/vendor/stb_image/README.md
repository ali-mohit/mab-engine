# SECURITY ISSUE

Based on the README file that you can find in the [stb repository](https://github.com/nothings/stb/tree/master), there are some security issues in the stb library. It should be replaced as soon as possible with another library.

The text from the stb library README:

"This project discusses security-relevant bugs publicly in GitHub Issues and Pull Requests, and it may take significant time for security fixes to be implemented or merged. If this poses an unreasonable risk to your project, do not use stb libraries."
